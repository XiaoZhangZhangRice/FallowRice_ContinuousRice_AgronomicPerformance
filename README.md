The dataset covered here includes both data used for the paper as well as some additional data. 

Additional data: 

In 2021 and 2021, topdress N (30 kg N ha-1) was applied to 0 kg N ha-1 and 185 kg N ha-1 subplots midseason. 

Topdressed plots are indicated with (1) in the "topdress" column of datasets. (0) and NIL refers to no topdress. 

Note that data from topdressed plots were not used in the paper. The data is only shared with such that individuals who may require such data in their research have access to it in a public repository.
